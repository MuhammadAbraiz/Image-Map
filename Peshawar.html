                    The Sir Cunningham Clock Tower was built in 1900, and was named after the former British governor of the province. The tower is also referred to as Ghanta Ghar and stands 26 meters tall.

                    The old clock sits in the thick of the chaos in Peshawar’s Old City- you can’t miss it as it lies only 200 m from the iconic Chowk Yadgar. Due to a complete lack of parking in or around Ghanta Ghar, hailing a rickshaw is the best way to see this famous landmark of Peshawar.
