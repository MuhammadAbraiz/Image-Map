                    city is located in Muzaffarabad District, near the confluence of the Jhelum and Neelum rivers.The
                    capital of the Azad Jammu & Kashmir is situated at the confluence of the Jhelum & Neelum rivers. It
                    is 138 kms from Rawalpindi and about 76 kms from Abbottabad. The present name of Muzaffarabad has

                    Muzaffarabad FortThere are two historical forts on opposite sides of the Neelum River. Red Fort and
                    Black Fort The construction of the Red Fort was finally completed in 1646 by Sultan Muzaffar Khan,
                    the founder of Muzaffarabad city. After the Mughals took over Kashmir, the fort lost its importance.
                    The Mughals were more interested in Kabul, Bukhara, and Badakshan. During the period of Durrani
                    rule, however, the fort again once again assumed its importance. Maharaja Gulab Singh and Rambir
                    Singh, the Dogra rulers, reconstructed and extended the fort for their political and military
                    operations. Towards the middle of 1947, the Dogra forces left, leaving the fort abandoned. The
                    architecture of the fort shows that great experts in design and structure participated in its
                    construction. It is surrounded on three sides by theNeelum River formally known as the Kishenganga
                    River. The northern part of the fort had terraces with steps leading to the bank of the river. The
                    eastern side was very well protected from the hazards of flood waters, but some parts on the north
                    side have suffered damage. There used to be an inn at the entrance to the fort, but only traces of
                    that structure remain now.
